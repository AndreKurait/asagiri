# Guest kernel source offer

The Asagiri guest kernel is Linux under GPL-2.0-only. For every Asagiri release, the
complete corresponding source for the bundled kernel is available from the
same download site as the release:

`https://download.runkiri.com/Asagiri-VERSION-kernel-source.tar.xz`

Replace `VERSION` with the Asagiri release version. The archive contains the exact
upstream Linux release, all Asagiri patches already applied, the kernel
configuration, and the build inputs. It is also reproducible from this checkout
with:

```sh
scripts/ci/kernel-source.sh target/Asagiri-VERSION-kernel-source.tar.xz
```

This offer to provide the corresponding source is valid for three years from
the date of each release. The guest kernel is a separate work from the
Apache-2.0 Asagiri application.
